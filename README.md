## ðŸ“° Customer Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing

### Project Abstract
The **Sentiment Analysis** System leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning** to classify customer reviews into sentiments such as **positive, negative, and neutral.** By analyzing textual data, the system provides businesses with valuable insights into customer satisfaction, emerging issues, and overall brand perception.

The framework includes **text preprocessing** (tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization), feature extraction, and classification using multiple machine learning models. Automating sentiment classification enhances decision-making by offering real-time feedback, reducing manual analysis efforts, and ensuring consistency in sentiment evaluation.

## **Conclusion**
This **Customer Sentiment Analysis** project demonstrates the potential of **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Language Models** for text classification tasks, particularly for categorizing customer reviews. The comparative analysis reveals that **RoBERTa**, a transformer-based model, outperforms traditional methods and deep learning models in terms of **accuracy, precision, and recall**. By employing various algorithms, we gain insights into the **strengths and weaknesses of each model**, allowing us to choose the most suitable approach for **customer sentiment analysis**.
